My name is Joshua Severud. I was born in North Dakota, but have lived in a few other places. I have a B.A. from the University of North Dakota where I double majored in philosophy and English. I have a M.A. from Louisiana State University where I studied philosophy further. I have interests in ethics and 19th and 20th century French thought, but more about that can be found on my personal website. 

I have also lived in France, and I am currently living in Seoul, South Korea with my partner Aur√©lie. On this blog we will share our adventures!
